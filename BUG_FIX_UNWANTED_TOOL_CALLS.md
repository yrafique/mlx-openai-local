# Bug Fix: Unwanted Tool Calls on Simple Greetings

## üêõ The Problem

When typing "hi" in the UI at http://localhost:7006, the system was:
1. Performing a web search about "Tech Sales Consultants"
2. Using tools even though web search toggle was OFF
3. Displaying hardcoded content unrelated to the user input

## üîç Root Causes

### Bug #1: Table Formatter Always Enabled
**Location:** `ui/ControlPanel.py:510`

```python
# BEFORE (BUGGY):
# Always include table formatter for beautiful data display
selected_tools.extend(TABLE_FORMATTER_TOOL_DEFINITIONS)
```

**Problem:** The table formatter was added to EVERY chat request, even when:
- All tool toggles were OFF
- User just wanted a simple conversation
- No tabular data was expected

### Bug #2: Hardcoded "Tech Sales Consultants" Title
**Location:** `server/tools/table_formatter.py:79`

```python
# BEFORE (BUGGY):
def _format_country_table(countries: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> str:
    table = "## üåç Best Countries for Tech Sales Consultants\n\n"
```

**Problem:** The function had hardcoded text about "Tech Sales Consultants" from test data. When the LLM incorrectly called this tool, it displayed this misleading title.

### Bug #3: Weak System Prompt
**Location:** `ui/ControlPanel.py:132`

**Problem:** The system prompt wasn't explicit enough about NOT using tools for simple greetings, leading the LLM to over-use available tools.

## ‚úÖ The Fixes

### Fix #1: Conditional Table Formatter
**Location:** `ui/ControlPanel.py:509-512`

```python
# AFTER (FIXED):
# Include table formatter only when other tools are enabled
# (web search or financial tools might return tabular data)
if enable_web_search or enable_financial:
    selected_tools.extend(TABLE_FORMATTER_TOOL_DEFINITIONS)
```

**Result:** Table formatter is only available when it makes sense (web search or financial queries that might return tables).

### Fix #2: Generic Table Title
**Location:** `server/tools/table_formatter.py:79`

```python
# AFTER (FIXED):
def _format_country_table(countries: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> str:
    table = "## üåç Country Comparison\n\n"
```

**Result:** Uses a generic title that works for any country comparison data, not just "Tech Sales Consultants".

### Fix #3: Stronger System Prompt
**Location:** `ui/ControlPanel.py:132-147`

```python
# AFTER (FIXED):
system_prompt = """You are a helpful AI assistant with access to tools. CRITICAL: Only use tools when absolutely necessary.

**NEVER use tools for:**
- Greetings (hi, hello, how are you, etc.) - just respond naturally
- General knowledge you already have
- Simple conversations
- Math you can solve
- Coding or explanations
- Questions you can answer directly

**ONLY use tools when:**
- User explicitly asks for current/real-time data (stocks, news, prices)
- You genuinely need external information you don't have
- User requests a specific tool feature (search, transcription, etc.)

**Default behavior:** Answer directly. Use tools as a last resort only when you truly need external information."""
```

**Result:** LLM is explicitly instructed to NOT use tools for simple greetings and conversations.

## üß™ Testing

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Clear chat and test simple greeting:**
   - Open http://localhost:7006
   - Ensure all tool toggles are OFF
   - Type "hi" or "hello"
   - Expected: Simple greeting response, NO tools called

2. **Test with tools enabled:**
   - Enable Web Search toggle
   - Ask "What is the weather today?"
   - Expected: Web search is called, table formatter available if needed

3. **Test financial tools:**
   - Enable Real-time Finance toggle
   - Ask "What is AAPL stock price?"
   - Expected: Financial tool called, table formatter available for results

## üìù Summary

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Tool Availability** | Table formatter always on | Only when web search or finance enabled |
| **Simple Greetings** | Often triggered unwanted tools | Responds directly without tools |
| **Hardcoded Text** | "Tech Sales Consultants" appeared | Generic "Country Comparison" |
| **System Prompt** | Permissive tool usage | Conservative, explicit restrictions |

## üöÄ Impact

- ‚úÖ Simpler responses for simple queries
- ‚úÖ No unwanted tool calls
- ‚úÖ Better performance (fewer LLM calls)
- ‚úÖ More predictable behavior
- ‚úÖ No confusing hardcoded content

## üìö Files Modified

1. `ui/ControlPanel.py` - Made table formatter conditional + improved system prompt
2. `server/tools/table_formatter.py` - Removed hardcoded "Tech Sales Consultants" title

## ‚ú® Recommendation

Always test the UI with:
- All tools OFF
- Simple greetings ("hi", "hello", "how are you")
- Basic questions that don't need external data

This ensures the model responds naturally without unnecessary tool calls.
