## UI Enhancements

### 1. Better Text Formatting

**Before:**
```python
f"The current price of {symbol} is ${price}. Change: {change}..."
# Result: All text runs together
```

**After:**
```python
f"**{symbol}** is currently trading at **${price}**.\n\n"
f"📊 **Change:** {change}\n"
f"📈 **Previous Close:** ${prev_close}\n"
# Result: Properly formatted with emojis and line breaks
```

### 2. Success Banner

Added visual indicator for successful financial data:

```python
if is_financial and result_data.get("status") == "success":
    st.success("✅ Real-time Financial Data")
    st.markdown(result_data['answer'])
```

### 3. Detailed Metrics Panel

Created collapsible panel with organized metrics:

```python
with st.expander("📊 Detailed Metrics", expanded=False):
    col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)

    with col1:
        st.metric("Current Price", f"${price}", f"{change} ({pct}%)")

    with col2:
        st.metric("Previous Close", f"${prev_close}")

    with col3:
        st.metric("Exchange", exchange)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean, organized layout
- ✅ 3-column metric cards

    with st.status("💰 Fetching real-time financial data...", expanded=True):
        st.write(f"📊 Querying {tool_name}...")
