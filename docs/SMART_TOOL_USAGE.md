# Smart Tool Usage Guide

## Overview

Your MLX Omni Server now has **intelligent tool selection** - the model only uses tools when genuinely needed, not for every query. This makes conversations more natural, like HuggingFace Chat.

## Recent Improvements

### 1. **Tools are Opt-In (Not Always On)**

**Before:**
- 🌐 Web Search: **Enabled by default**
- 💰 Finance: **Enabled by default**
- Result: Model tried to search for "Hello" 😅

**After:**
- 🌐 Web Search: **Disabled by default** (toggle to enable)
- 💰 Finance: **Disabled by default** (toggle to enable)
- Result: Model responds naturally to greetings ✅

### 2. **Intelligent System Prompt**

Added a smart system prompt that instructs the model:

**When TO use tools:**
- Web Search: Current events, news, real-time info you don't know
- Financial Tools: Specific stock/crypto prices or market data
- Voice Tools: When user provides audio or wants audio output

**When NOT to use tools:**
- ❌ Simple greetings (Hello, Hi, How are you)
- ❌ General knowledge questions
- ❌ Casual conversation
- ❌ Math you can solve directly
- ❌ Coding questions
- ❌ Concept explanations

**Principle:** Be conservative - if you can answer directly, do so!

### 3. **Better Temperature Settings**

**Before:**
```bash
TEMPERATURE=0          # Too deterministic/robotic
TOP_P=1.0             # No diversity
```

**After:**
```bash
TEMPERATURE=0.7       # More natural and varied
TOP_P=0.9            # Better response diversity
```

Result: More human-like, varied responses like HuggingFace Chat.

## How It Works

### Example 1: Simple Greeting

**User:** "Hello"

**Model Behavior:**
- ✅ Responds directly: "Hello! How can I help you today?"
- ❌ Does NOT search web
- ❌ Does NOT call any tools

### Example 2: Current Information

**User:** "What's the latest news about AI?"

**With Web Search Enabled:**
- ✅ Uses web search tool (legitimate need)
- ✅ Fetches current information
- ✅ Provides up-to-date response

**With Web Search Disabled:**
- ✅ Responds based on training knowledge
- ℹ️ May suggest enabling web search for latest info

### Example 3: Stock Price

**User:** "What's Apple stock price?"

**With Finance Tools Enabled:**
- ✅ Calls `get_stock_price("AAPL")`
- ✅ Returns real-time price

**With Finance Tools Disabled:**
- ✅ Explains what you asked about
- ℹ️ Suggests enabling finance tools for real-time data

## UI Control Panel

### Default State (Clean, Like HuggingFace)

```
🌐 Enable Web Search:  ⬜ OFF
💰 Real-time Finance:  ⬜ OFF
🎤 Voice Input:        ⬜ OFF
⚡ Live Streaming:     ☑️  ON  (for smooth experience)
```

**Result:** Model behaves like a standard chat AI, answering directly from knowledge.

### When You Need Tools

Simply toggle them on:

```
🌐 Enable Web Search:  ☑️  ON  <- Enable when needed
💰 Real-time Finance:  ☑️  ON  <- Enable for stock/crypto
🎤 Voice Input:        ☑️  ON  <- Enable for audio
```

## Configuration

### In `.env` File

```bash
# Model behaves more naturally
TEMPERATURE=0.7       # Not 0 (too robotic)
TOP_P=0.9            # Slight randomness for variety

# UI is smart by default
UI_ENABLED=true
AUTO_START_UI=true
```

### System Prompt (in Code)

The intelligent system prompt is automatically added when tools are enabled:

```python
# ui/ControlPanel.py - Line 129-144
system_prompt = """You are a helpful AI assistant. You have access to
various tools, but you should ONLY use them when the user's question
genuinely requires external information or capabilities.

**When to use tools:**
- Web Search: Only when asked about current events, news, real-time information...
- Financial Tools: Only when asked about specific stock prices...
- Voice Tools: Only when user provides audio...

**When NOT to use tools:**
- Simple greetings (Hello, Hi, How are you)
- General knowledge questions you can answer directly
- Casual conversation...

**Be conservative:** If you can answer directly without tools, do so."""
```

## Comparison with HuggingFace Chat

### HuggingFace Chat Behavior
- Default: Clean chat interface
- Tools: Available but not always active
- Responses: Natural, varied, contextual

### Your MLX Omni Server (Now)
- ✅ Default: Clean chat interface
- ✅ Tools: Available but opt-in
- ✅ Responses: Natural, varied, contextual
- ✅ Plus: 99% function calling accuracy when you need it!

## Testing

### Test 1: Simple Greeting

```
You: Hello
Model: Hello! How can I help you today?
```
✅ No tools used

### Test 2: Math

```
You: What's 15 * 23 + 47?
Model: Let me calculate that: 15 × 23 = 345, plus 47 = 392
```
✅ Direct answer, no tools

### Test 3: Current Event (Web Search OFF)

```
You: What happened in tech news today?
Model: I don't have access to current news. My knowledge cutoff is
January 2025. Would you like me to explain recent tech trends I know about,
or you can enable web search for the latest news.
```
✅ Honest response, suggests enabling tools

### Test 4: Current Event (Web Search ON)

```
You: What happened in tech news today?
Model: [Uses web search]
🌐 Searching the web...
[Provides current news with sources]
```
✅ Uses tools appropriately

### Test 5: Stock Price (Finance OFF)

```
You: What's Tesla stock price?
Model: I don't have access to real-time stock prices. My knowledge is from
January 2025. You can enable the finance tools for current market data.
```
✅ Suggests enabling tools

### Test 6: Stock Price (Finance ON)

```
You: What's Tesla stock price?
Model: [Uses get_stock_price tool]
💰 Fetching real-time financial data...
Tesla (TSLA): $245.67 USD
Change: +$3.45 (+1.42%)
Last updated: 2025-10-18 15:30:00
```
✅ Uses tools appropriately

## Advanced: Custom Tool Behavior

### Modify System Prompt

Edit `ui/ControlPanel.py` around line 129:

```python
system_prompt = """Your custom instructions here..."""
```

### Per-Tool Instructions

You can add specific instructions for each tool type:

```python
if "web_search" in [t["function"]["name"] for t in tools]:
    system_prompt += "\n\nFor web searches, prioritize recent sources."

if "financial" in [t["function"]["name"] for t in tools]:
    system_prompt += "\n\nFor financial data, always show the timestamp."
```

- No surprise tool calls

## Summary

Your MLX Omni Server now intelligently uses tools:

✅ **Before:** Tools always on → model searches for "Hello"
✅ **After:** Tools opt-in → model responds naturally

✅ **Before:** Temperature=0 → robotic responses
✅ **After:** Temperature=0.7 → human-like variation

✅ **Before:** No guidance → model unsure when to use tools
✅ **After:** Smart system prompt → clear tool usage rules

**Result:** A chat experience like HuggingFace Chat, with powerful tools available when you need them! 🚀

## Quick Start

1. **Open UI:** http://localhost:7006
